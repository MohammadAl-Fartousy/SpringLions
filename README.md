# SpringLions
Why are we doing this? 
I wanted to create this in mind for zoo keepers to keep track of their animals. based on their ages and sex and id and their habitat and lastly their names. all this information has been given so that the zoo keepers can track what lions need care based on their specific data. My favorite animal has always been a lion for it represents strength to me. based on this Idea I have decided to relate this application on lions.
How I expected the challenge to go What went well?
I expect the challenge to be difficult since there are a lot of variables and linking the variables may cause some conflict in my code
the creation of the data tables performed how I wanted to however I did have to remove some of the data columns and leave for future development.
I am really happy that I able to go through past recordings in order for me to solve my code.
What didn't go as planned?
I have had some problems setting up postman but in the end I was able to resolve it through past recordings!
